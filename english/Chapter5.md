# Chapter 5: Mid-level API in TensorFlow

Mid-level API in TensorFlow includes:

* Data pipeline (tf.data)

* Feature column (tf.feature_column)

* Activation function (tf.nn)

* Model layer (tf.keras.layers)

* Loss function (tf.keras.losses)

* Evaluation function (tf.keras.metrics)

* Optimizer (tf.keras.optimizers)

* Callback function (tf.keras.callbacks)

If we compare a model to a house, then these fourth level APIs are the walls.
